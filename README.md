Data analysis concepts along with different project implementation 

<h3>Project 1:- Learning Portal</h3>

[Learning Portal](https://github.com/Mithlesh7877/data_work/tree/main/LearningPortalAnalysis)
is implementation of complete business use case for marketing campaign analysis and optimizing different aspects</br>
and improving convertion rate and reducing cost incurred in marketing </br></br>
- This project consist of demo databse of online learning platform like Udemy,EdX and tables consisting data about </br>
  online campaigning parameters such as urchin tracking module (<b>UTM</b>)</br>
  Different analysis are done along with real-world assignment from client and how analysis are done in organizations.</br>
  
 <h5>Tables:</h5>
  1. order_item_refunds</br>
  2. order_items</br>
